==================================
   PNP library for Pepper robot

==================================

1. Install naoqi C++ SDK and create a qi workspace

   http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/dev/cpp/install_guide.html#cpp-install-guide


2. Compiling
	
	* Follow instructions to compile PNP in PNP folder

	* Compile PNPnaoqi stuff:

	$ cd <PATH_TO>/PetriNetPlans/PNPnaoqi
	$ qibuild configure -c linux64 -w <qi_ws>
	$ qibuild make -c linux64 -w <qi_ws>
	$ qibuild configure -c pepper -w <qi_ws>
	$ qibuild make -c pepper -w <qi_ws>


3. Preliminary Test

    * pnp_test
	- run 'pnp_test' in the folder containing 'plans' 
	  $ build-linux64/sdk/bin/pnp_test 
	  Program will terminate and you should not see any error.


3. Plan generation

    In the plan folder run

    $ ./gen_plan.bash <planname.plan> [<executionrules.er>]

    Example:

    $ ./gen_plan.bash test3.plan> test3.er

    This command generates <planname>.pnml


4. Plan execution

	
	* quick test
	- run 'run_test.sh' in the PNPnaoqi folder

	* full instructions
	- launch naoqi
	  $ <PATH_TO>/naoqi-sdk-2.5.5.5-linux64/naoqi
	- launch actions
	  (set PEPPER_IP=localhost if needed)
	  run the action servers (cd actions; python init_actions.py)
	- launch pnp_naoqi
	  run 'pnp_naoqi' in the folder containing 'plans'
	- send the plan to be executed to pnp_naoqi
	  run 'run_plan.py' with the name of a plan
	  $ python run_plan.py --plan <plan_name> (e.g., 'python run_plan.py --plan test1')
	  (actions are started and the plan terminates after execution, plan can be restarted 
      or stopped with 'python run_plan.py --plan stop')


6. Test single actions

    Start the action servers and use action_cmd script to start/end/interrupt single actions

    Example:

    Terminal 1:
    $ cd actions
    $ python init_actions

    Terminal 2:
    $ cd actions
    $ ./action_cmd -a <actionname> -p <params> -c <start|end|interrupt>



7. Uploading and running on the robot

	On local machine: 
	edit 'upload.sh' to match your Pepper environment and run it

	OnPepper:
    execute actions and plans as described before
    (without launching naoqi and setting PEPPER_IP=localhost)	


==========================================================================

== Note about timeouts ==

There are two ways of introducing timeout of actions in the plan files.

1. Executing an action up to n seconds

Use this form in the plan file 'A|n'

Example:

  lookfor|30

will execute the action lookfor for at most 30 seconds, then it will continue with the next action.

2. Using the timeout condition

For each action an automatic timeout condition timeout_<actionname>_<time> is available.
An execution rule can thus contain rules based on this event.

Example:

Plan:
    lookfor

ER:
    *if* timeout_lookfor_30 *during* lookfor *do* somethingelse; ...

In this case after 30 seconds from the start of the acction, the condition timeout_lookfor_30
will be true and will activate the recovery procedure of the ER
